# 🕒 WatchShop - Mobile Applications Project

This project was created as part of the **Mobile Applications** module in **Year 2**. The goal was to design and build a fully functional Android app for a fictional watch store, integrating both frontend and backend systems.

## 📱 Overview

**WatchShop** is an Android application that simulates an online watch retail experience. It features a dynamic product catalog, user account functionality, and the ability to favourite items — all powered by a custom backend API and cloud services.
